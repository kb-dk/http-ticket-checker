# http-ticket-checker

Given a valid ticket, as generated by https://github.com/statsbiblioteket/ticket-system
and put into a reachable memcached, visiting
`http://localhost:3000/3/5/a/1/35a1aa76-97a1-4f1b-b5aa-ad2a246eeeec.snapshot.0.jpeg?ticket=b981e462-710a-43a2-b1d1-684c6b8c077d`
will fetch the ticket `b981e462-710a-43a2-b1d1-684c6b8c077d`, and match it against

1. the user ip-address
2. the resource 35a1aa76-97a1-4f1b-b5aa-ad2a246eeeec
3. the presentation type defined in the configuration

Any file beginning with a uuid will be server, as long as the ticket is valid.
Files can either be served directly by http-ticket-checker, or by a reverse http-proxy
using the `X-Sendfile` header.
